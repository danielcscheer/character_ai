# Character Creator AI

Welcome to Character Creator AI, where you can build your own AI character in a convenient web app interface

## To Run the App
Running this app requires that you have streamlit installed on your machine. See [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation) for installation guidelines.

The app uses Anthropic as a base LLM for the chatbot. This code assumes that your Anthropic API token is defined in a `.env` file in the app directory.

Once the dependencies are installed and the token is set, you can run the app by running `streamlit run character_creator_chatbot.py` from the app directory, which will start the web app.
